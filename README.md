# Computer-Graphics-1st-Project
This project demonstrates linear interpolation of points inside triangles to generate a visual representation of a pentagon. It is implemented in C++ using OpenGL, GLFW, and GLEW. The project showcases fundamental graphics programming concepts such as vertex buffer objects (VBOs), vertex array objects (VAOs), shaders, and basic rendering pipelines.
